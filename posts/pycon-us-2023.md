# Attending PyCon US 2023!

## Motivation & Preparation

Last year, Luis (a mentor at work with whom I connected over Python) strongly recommended I attend a conference like PyCon or PyCascades.  He emphasized the famously friendly and inclusive community and opportunities for talking with interesting people, and quipped that he goes every year because it's "like his Christmas".  After researching both events, I settled on PyCon US 2023 in Salt Lake City, Utah.

This was my first conference, professional or otherwise, and I was nervously excited.  To prepare, I read guides online and particularly enjoyed Trey Hunner's [*How to have a great first PyCon*](https://treyhunner.com/2018/04/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-first-pycon/) and [*Making the most of the PyCon sprints*](https://treyhunner.com/2019/04/making-the-most-of-the-pycon-sprints/), and Al Sweigart's [*How to do PyCon (or any tech conference)*](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/how-to-do-pycon.html).  I spent a lot of time on PyCon's conference website reading about the various activities, events, and talks.  During most time slots there were several concurrent options, which necessitated prioritization!  The guides all cautioned against filling up my time with solely conference talks, as they are all recorded and freely available later.  Instead, they advocated for having meeting other conference-goers!  To that end, I picked 3 talks that sounded especially interesting and left the remainder of my time unbooked.

At Luis' suggestion and with his encouragement, I prepared a 5-minute lightning talk in the hopes of presenting it during the conference.  This is not something I would have considered doing on my own, so I'm thankful for the push!  I had committed to the idea *before* knowing the number of people that would be watching (100+), so I'm glad that detail wasn't presented to me upfront.  

Additionally, based on advice from Al's guide, I decided to design business cards, which led to me also making a personal website.  The upcoming conference proved to be an excellent catalyst - I've always thought having a personal website was a cool idea but was previously stymied by a lack of web development skills.  I learned some basics from [Mozilla Developer Network's guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) and [FreeCodeCamp's courses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and I'm pleased with the results!


## At the conference

The full breadth of PyCon was from Wednesday April 19th to Thursday April 27th, with the majority of activities occurring Friday-Sunday.  

I chose to start on **Thursday** - I picked up my badge, explored the conference center (the Salt Palace is *huge*), and attended Capital One's sponsor talk on serverless Python application best-practices.  I also listened to the Newcomer Orientation, and was pleasantly surprised - they encouraged meeting people over talk attendance.  It's one thing to read advice online and another to hear in a room of hundreds of newcomers.  Trey Hunner was even one of the folks on stage!  After the Orientation was the Opening Reception in the Expo hall, which turned out to be the first opportunity to mingle with companies at their booths.

On Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, I spent time helping out at the check-in area.  This activity turned out to be one of my favorite parts of the conference - it was easy for me to strike up conversations because I automatically had two things in common with everyone else (Python and being at the check-in desk) and talking filled the time when nobody needed to register!  **Friday** morning was especially busy, since it was the first full conference day.

I learned about PyScript shortly before the conference (from [Peter Wang's PyCon US 2022 keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKfkCY7cmBQ)) and was curious to learn more about it!  One of the folks I met at the check-in desk introduced me to a PyScript contributor, and it was interesting chatting with him about his involvement with the project.  On Friday afternoon I attended [*Build Yourself a PyScript*](https://pyscript.net/), a talk that gave a high-level overview of how PyScript works (tl;dr Javascript + WebAssembly).

Friday evening was spent at two company-sponsored off-site events: Capital One hosted a fancy charcuterie-and-mingling event at the [McCune Mansion](https://mccunemansion.com/), and AWS + Superblocks threw a "PyParty" with a dinner buffet and open bar at the three-story [Squatters Pub Brewery](https://www.saltlakebrewingco.com/squatters).  I met interesting people at both events, so I'm glad I went!  The PyParty especially provided an opportunity for longer conversations than I had at most conference breakfasts/lunches.

**Saturday** was a lighter conference day for me, but as with Friday and Sunday I made it a priority to attend the conference breakfasts and lunches.  These were another of my favorite conference activities, as the hall was full of large (10-person?) circular tables each with a different mix of people.  The most difficult part was always choosing a table - I usually spent a minute or more walking around to survey the options.  I considered how many people were at each table and tried to gauge whether the conversation was already flowing and how much longer they might spend at the table.  After picking where to sit, though, I was always made to feel welcome and had fun learning about the folks at the table!

I submitted my lightning talk in the hopes of presenting at the Saturday PM session, but didn't make it.  In the afternoon, I tried again, signing up for the last session, Sunday AM.  This time, I included a link to my slides on the submission board to show that I was prepared.  I don't know whether the volunteer(s) picking the talks looked at my slides, but I *was* selected as a backup for the Sunday AM session!

Waking up on **Sunday** morning was tough, as I needed to wake up early to be at the conference center by 7:30am MDT (6:30am PDT, my home time zone) to keep my lightning talk (backup) slot.  It was a ~15-20 minute walk from my AirBnB to the conference center, so I got up around 6-6:15am MDT.  I was the last backup speaker, but I did get a chance to give my talk!!  I'm very pleased with how it went - the cutoff is 5 minutes, and I clocked in just over 4 minutes (the fruits of hours of practice).  Speaking in front of such a large audience was not as daunting as I'd imagined - the practice runs helped, as did the blinding lights preventing me from seeing most of the room!  Right after the talk I got breakfast and treated myself to sweets at Eva's bakery, my own private version of Mariatta's #icecreamselfie.

In the afternoon I attended Al Sweigart's talk on code tooling in 2023, and I intend to try out Ruff (very fast Rust-based Python linter).  I attended Guido van Rossum's keynote, where he reflected on the history of the PSF and PyCon (this was the 20th!), and watched the conference closing.  Finally, I swung by the intro to open source sprinting session as I was interested in participating in Monday's sprints - I snagged the [workshop material](https://github.com/chalmerlowe/intro_to_sprinting) and headed home for dinner. I was pleased that I was already familiar with some of the material (git / GitHub) and was very hungry!

My last conference day was **Monday**, the first of four open source sprint days.  I reviewed the documentation for the listed projects and initially selected Beeware [toga](https://github.com/beeware/toga), a native cross-platform GUI framework.  The Beeware room was full, but after lunch I found an open seat.  The lead project maintainer, Russell, recommended that I take a look at [briefcase](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase) instead, as there were more beginner-friendly open issues.  I spent the afternoon trying to run the test suite -- a particular test failed using tox, but ran fine with pytest.  I spelunked through the failing test and relevant code, but didn't manage to figure it out.  It was still an interesting experience, though!


## Takeaways

### What went well

PyCon was a great way to meet other folks in the Python community, with many opportunities to do so - conference meals, off-site events, and volunteering were my favorites.  The closing presentation noted that 77% of attendees were first-timers (myself included) - I don't know how this percentage changes year-to-year, but I'd bet half or more of attendees are first-timers in any given year.  This means there's always new people to meet, should I go again!

In order to make the most of my conversations, I carried a small notebook and pen with me and jotted down notes about the folks with whom I had spoken so that I could connect with them online.  This was not my idea, Al Sweigart recommended it in his PyCon advice article, and it proved useful!  I talked to many people during over five days, and if I had waited until Monday evening to write down my thoughts most of the details would have been already lost.

Between the conference activities I discussed in my recap, I spent a lot of time alone to recharge.  I walked around outside the conference center to stretch my legs and clear my head, and sat in a quiet corner to jot down notes and spend time on my laptop decompressing by playing a game or working on a personal project.  This time was critical for me, as I would have gotten overwhelmed and burned out had I tried to spend all my time talking to people.

### What I'll do differently going forward

I made business cards to hand out at the conference, but didn't work up the nerve to hand any out until Sunday morning (the last full conference day).  I felt sheepish about handing out cards because nobody else I had talked to was handing out cards!  My goal in making business cards was to leave a memorable impression and make it easier for folks to connect with me online.  The cards contain my contact info and a [little Python "puzzle"](https://www.lyubogankov.dev/businesscard) meant to pique curiosity, which could be satiated by going to my webpage, which has linkedin / github links.  Next time, I'll feel less nervous about handing out cards!

And speaking of socials, I will better utilize the space on my badge in the future!  I had my first name and linkedin / github profiles on my badge, but I should have just had my first *and* last name on the badge and omitted the social media profiles.  I saw someone at the conference that utilized the extra space on the badge to print a two-line quote, which I thought was clever!  I want to do something similar next time: name and something I like on the badge, and the business card will link folks to relevant online profiles.

Finally, I wish I had spent more intentional time at the expo hall.  I did talk to some companies and got several free T-shirts, but next time I will make a point of talking to every company and understanding how they use Python (or why their tool has Python bindings).  I'm also curious about their business models, how long they've been active, etc.  The best approach will probably be to do preliminary research online and ask clarifying questions in person.

### Overall

Despite the things I'd have done differently, the conference was a unique experience that pushed me out of my comfort zone, both during preparation and at the event itself!


## SLC recommendations

I reserved a full day after the conference activities to explore SLC before heading home, as I'd never visited before!  Between the full day and other pockets of time, I enjoyed:

- [Museum of Natural History of Utah](https://nhmu.utah.edu/) -- Luis suggested visiting.  This was my first time seeing full-sized dinosaur skeletons in real life!

- Hiking -- SLC is *directly* adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and the scenery is quite beautiful.  I hiked the to the [Living Room Lookout](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/the-living-room-lookout-trail) with my SO.

- [Clark Planetarium](https://slco.org/clark-planetarium/) -- Free science museum with many interactive displays.  My favorite part was getting to touch a real meteorite.

Food highlights:

1. [Arempas](https://www.arempas.com/) -- incredible Venezuelan food with generous portions!  We ate here three times, and I enjoyed everything I tried (empanadas, cachapas, pabellon arepa).

2. [Greek Souvlaki](https://www.greeksouvlaki.com/) -- my new all-time-favorite fast food joint.  I'd recommend the souvlaki plate over a gyro, though that was tasty too.  The plate consists of flavorful yellow rice, romaine lettuce, a skewer (the souvlaki), and warm pita bread - it's a filling, delicious meal.

3. [Eva's Bakery](https://www.evasbakeryslc.com/) -- very cute bakery and cafe in downtown SLC.  I'm a sucker for bakeries, and ordered their Kouign Amann and Monkey Bread to recharge after my lightning talk.  Both were scrumptious!

4. [Kahve Cafe](https://www.kahvecafeslc.com/) -- Turkish coffee and Middle Eastern / Mediterranean treats are a potent combo!  I had a small cup of Turkish coffee, a savory Bulgarian-feta-and-parsely *borek* and a ramekin full of *keşkül* (Turkish milk pudding with almonds) all of which I thoroughly enjoyed.

5. (*Honorable mention*) [Street Tacos](https://streettacosut.com/) -- Luis mentioned he ate *chapulines* (toasted/fried grasshoppers) here - unfortunately, it's a seasonal item and was not available.  I did eat a *nopal* taco (sautéed cactus leaf), another item I've never seen anywhere else.  Unique menu, if you're here in the summer the *chapulines* should be available!
