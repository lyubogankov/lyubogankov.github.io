# Attending PyCon US 2023!

## Why PyCon + preparation

Last year, Luis (a mentor at work with whom I connected over Python) strongly recommended I attend a conference like PyCon or PyCascades.  He emphasized the famously friendly and inclusive community and opportunities for talking with interesting people, and quipped that he goes every year because it's "like his Christmas".  After researching both events, I settled on PyCon US 2023 in Salt Lake City, Utah.

This was my first conference, professional or otherwise, and I was nervously excited.  To prepare, I read guides online and particularly enjoyed Trey Hunner's [*How to have a great first PyCon*](https://treyhunner.com/2018/04/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-first-pycon/) and [*Making the most of the PyCon sprints*](https://treyhunner.com/2019/04/making-the-most-of-the-pycon-sprints/), and Al Sweigart's [*How to do PyCon (or any tech conference)*](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/how-to-do-pycon.html).  I spent a lot of time on PyCon's conference website reading about the various activities and events, as well as about the talks (once the schedule was posted).

At Luis' suggestion and with his encouragement, I prepared a 5-minute lightning talk in the hopes of presenting it during the conference - this is not something I would have considered doing on my own, so I'm thankful for the push!  I had committed to the idea *before* knowing the number of people that would be watching (100+), so I'm glad that detail wasn't presented to me upfront.  

Additionally, based on advice from Al's guide, I decided to design business cards, which led to me also making a personal website.  The upcoming conference proved to be an excellent catalyst - I've always thought having a personal website was a cool idea but was previously stymied by a lack of web development skills.  I learned some basics from [Mozilla Developer Network's guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) and [FreeCodeCamp's courses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and I'm pleased with the results!

## SLC recommendations

I reserved a full day after the conference activities to explore SLC before heading home, as I'd never visited before!  Here are two activities I really enjoyed:

- [Museum of Natural History of Utah](https://nhmu.utah.edu/) -- Luis suggested visiting.  This was my first time seeing full-sized dinosaur skeletons in real life!

- Hiking -- SLC is *directly* adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and the scenery is quite beautiful.  I hiked the to the [Living Room Lookout](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/the-living-room-lookout-trail) with my SO.  She went on several hikes during the trip, and her favorite was []().

Food highlights:

1. [Arempas](https://www.arempas.com/) -- incredible Venezualan food with generous portions!  We ate here three times, and I enjoyed everything I tried (empanadas, cachapas, pabellon arepa).

2. [Greek Souvlaki](https://www.greeksouvlaki.com/) -- my new all-time-favorite fast food joint.  I'd recommend the souvlaki plate over a gyro, though that was tasty too.  The plate consists of flavorful yellow rice, romaine lettuce, a skewer (the souvlaki), and warm pita bread - it's a filling, delicious meal.

3. [Eva's Bakery](https://www.evasbakeryslc.com/) -- very cute bakery and cafe in downtown SLC.  I'm a sucker for bakeries, and ordered their Kouign Amann and Monkey Bread to recharge after my lightning talk.  Both were scrumptious!

4. [Kahve Cafe](https://www.kahvecafeslc.com/) -- Turkish coffee and Middle Eastern / Medeterranian treats are a potent combo!  I had a small cup of Turkish coffee, a savory Bulgarian-feta-and-parsely *borek* and a ramekin full of *keşkül*, Turkish milk pudding with almonds, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed.

5. (*Honorable mention*) [Street Tacos](https://streettacosut.com/) -- Luis mentioned he ate *chapulines* (toasted/fried grasshoppers) here - unfortunately, it's a seasonal item and was not available.  I did eat a *nopal* taco (sautéed cactus leaf), another item I've never seen anywhere else.  Unique menu, if you're here in the summer the *chapulines* should be available!
